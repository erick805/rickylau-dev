## My Journey to Code

It all started Fall of 2017, I had just come back from a hiatus in China, and was
contemplating my life decisions. Having been in the fitness workforce for more
than 6 years, I still enjoy it very much so, but I was missing the learning threshold.
Not to mention it is physically tasking on the body depending on who and what you operate on.

So I was losing both mentally in growth and physically in health. Don't get me wrong I was young
and despite all the critics I maintained a healthy lifestyle of training 4-8 clients a day and
teaching 7 classes a day. It was fun and I still love it till this very day, but for me, I wanted
challenge. So I opened my first online e-commerce business two months in coming back from China.

It was a very small startup consisting of two people, and that was where I first got my hands into programming.

Editing html and css within shopify's platform.

I enjoyed it very much so, and once finally finishing my degree in Kinesiology decided to venture into the world of code.

My first few months were self guided study with a couple of udemy courses and youtube videos and eventually I decided to invest into a bootcamp in Fall of 2018. I applied early 2019 and was immediately accepted into [Fullstack Academy of Code](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/).

Where I graduated, and am currently working as a Teaching Fellow for the upcoming cohort of WDF 1909.

I hope to combine my passions in tech, fitness, and business and bring use to the world!
