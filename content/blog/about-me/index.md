Just your everyday learner, human, and tech programmer.

## My Journey to Code

It all started Fall of 2017, I had just come back from hiatus and was
contemplating my life decisions. Having been in the fitness workforce for more
than 7 years, I still enjoy it very much so, but I was missing the challenge and learning threshold.

Don't get me wrong, I was young and maintained a healthy lifestyle of training 4-8 clients and coaching 7 classes a day. It was fun and I still love it till this very day, but I wanted mental growth. So I opened my first online e-commerce website two months after coming back from Asia.

It was a very small startup consisting of two people, and that was where I first got my hands into programming.

Editing HTML and CSS within Shopify's content management system.

Fascinated by the intricacies of modern web development, I decided to venture into the world of code.

My first few months were self guided study and eventually I decided to invest into full stack web development in Fall of 2018. I applied early 2019 and was immediately accepted into [Fullstack Academy of Code](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/).

Where I graduated and currently working as a Software Engineering Teaching Fellow for the next wave of scholarship engineering students.

In my free time, I am also a co-organizer and moderator of a Developer Circle in NYC, a localized community of Innovators hoping to spread the awareness of modern web development and emerging technology such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Always eager and hungry to learn, I am driven by incremental progress to unbox complex problems and hope to bring the world closer together through social value, physical & mental betterment, community, and empowerment.
